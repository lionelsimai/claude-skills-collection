## Tool
- `retention_campaign_planner` — Plan a retention campaign for at-risk members.

## Inputs
```json
{
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "goal": {
      "type": "string"
    },
    "timeframe_days": {
      "type": "integer"
    }
  },
  "required": [
    "goal"
  ]
}
```

## Example call
```json
{
  "goal": "Improve results next quarter with a fictional example team",
  "timeframe_days": 30
}
```

## Outputs
- `plugin` and `tool` — identifiers
- `kind` — `plan`
- `result` — the plan result, built only from the inputs and this plugin's items: segment at-risk members, personal outreach, value reminder, win-back offer, measure return rate
- `guardrails` — present on every result

## Guardrails
- No fabrication: use supplied facts only, mark anything missing as `[missing: ...]`
- Drafts only where the tool drafts — human approval required, no auto-send, no auto-post, no auto-remove
- No real people, client names or metrics in examples — fictional sample data only

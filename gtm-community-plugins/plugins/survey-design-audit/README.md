## Tool
- `survey_design_audit` — Audit a survey design before sending.

## Inputs
```json
{
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "text": {
      "type": "string"
    }
  },
  "required": [
    "text"
  ]
}
```

## Example call
```json
{
  "text": "one clear goal five questions or fewer rating scale are covered in this document."
}
```

## Outputs
- `plugin` and `tool` — identifiers
- `kind` — `audit`
- `result` — the audit result, built only from the inputs and this plugin's items: one clear goal, five questions or fewer, rating scale, open text option, thank you note
- `guardrails` — present on every result

## Guardrails
- No fabrication: use supplied facts only, mark anything missing as `[missing: ...]`
- Drafts only where the tool drafts — human approval required, no auto-send, no auto-post, no auto-remove
- No real people, client names or metrics in examples — fictional sample data only

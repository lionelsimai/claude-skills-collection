```

## Outputs

- `result` — the classify result, built only from the inputs and this plugin's items: funding, expansion, hiring, leadership change, technology adoption, no signal
- `guardrails` — present on every result

## Guardrails
- No fabrication: use supplied facts only, mark anything missing as `[missing: ...]`
- Drafts only where the tool drafts — human approval required, no auto-send, no auto-post, no auto-remove
- No real people, client names or metrics in examples — fictional sample data only

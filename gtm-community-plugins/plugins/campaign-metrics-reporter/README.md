{
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {

      "type": "object"
    },
    "amounts": {
      "type": "object"
    },
    "series": {
      "type": "array",
      "items": {
        "type": "number"
      }
    }
  },

}
```

## Example call

{
  "counts": {
    "sent": 100,
    "opened": 90,
    "replied": 80,
    "meetings": 70,
    "cost_per_meeting": 60
  }
}
```

## Outputs
- `plugin` and `tool` — identifiers
- `kind` — `analyze`
- `result` — the analyze result, built only from the inputs and this plugin's items: sent, opened, replied, meetings, cost per meeting
- `guardrails` — present on every result

## Guardrails
- No fabrication: use supplied facts only, mark anything missing as `[missing: ...]`
- Drafts only where the tool drafts — human approval required, no auto-send, no auto-post, no auto-remove
- No real people, client names or metrics in examples — fictional sample data only
